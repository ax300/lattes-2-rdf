# Lattes Platform

The Lattes Platform is an information system (integrated data-base, web-based query interface, etc.) maintained by the Brazilian Government to manage information on science, technology, and innovation related to individual researchers and institutions working in Brazil.

It is named after a Brazilian physicist, Cesar Lattes, and it is maintained by the federal bureau responsible for funding science and technology at the federal level, Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq, National Counsel of Scientific and Technological Development). Since all researchers and institutions are required to maintain their records up to date, the Lattes Platform can be used not only to obtain information on individual researchers but also to conduct performance evaluations at the organizational level.
